    Descripton:

    - RFMD_part_1 can be downloaded directly. RFMD_part_2 (4 compressed files) and RFMD_part_3 (3 compressed files) need to download all compressed files before decompressing them.

    - Different from the facial mask recognition (or detection) dataset, the masked face recognition dataset must include multiple masked and unmasked face images of the same subject.

        1. Real mask face recognition data set: After sorting, cleaning and labeling a sample from the Internet, it contains 5,000 mask faces and 90,000 normal faces of 525 people.

        2. Simulated mask face recognition data set: Put masks on the faces in the public data set to obtain a simulated mask face data set of 10,000 and 500,000 faces.
